 * needed in either the normal full-compression case or the transcoding-only
 * case.
 *
 * Most of the routines intended to be called directly by an application

 * parameter-setup helper routines, jcomapi.c for routines shared by
 * compression and decompression, and jctrans.c for the transcoding case.
